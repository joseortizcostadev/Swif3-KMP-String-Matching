# Knuth–Morris–Pratt string searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) with Swift

<h1> Description </h1>
• Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm is an efficient string search algoritm with running time O(n + m)
• This project implements the KMP in Swift using a String extension class. So, using the KMP.swift
  class, a given pattern can be matched in a string finding its first ocurrence on the text. 

<h1> Installation <\h1>
• Copy and paste KMP.swift file in your project directory.

<h1> Examples <\h1>
• "this is a string to be matched".matchWithKMP(forPattern: "g to") // matched = true, fromIndex = 15, toIndex = 18
